							<h3>Project Description</h3>
							
						
							RESILIENCE is structured on four Work Packages (WPs) and brings together an interdisciplinary group of scientists, from hydrologists, to climate modelers, to statisticians, to forest science experts. Within this structure, a WP based at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova will focus on novel statistical tools for extreme value modelling to support RESILIENCE activities. Goals of this WP include: development of robust probabilistic model of precipitation and storm wind velocities, and study and development of novel Bayesian methods for extreme value analysis<br><br>
							
						<h3>Candidate profile</h3>	

The successful candidate will be a highly motivated researcher with interdisciplinary interests and a strong background in statistical modelling and/or hydro-meteorology. Specifically, candidates holding a PhD in Statistics with a strong background in environmental applications or candidates holding a PhD in Hydrology, Atmospheric sciences, Environmental sciences and related areas with a strong background in stochastic modelling will be preferred. Other qualifications include significant programming skills and research abilities demonstrated by publications. A background in any area of Bayesian statistics is desirable, though not essential.<br><br>

The successful candidate will be based at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova and will collaborate with the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-ISAC). The candidate is expected to actively participate in the activities of the RESILIENCE team and with the life of the Department of Statistical Sciences.<br><br>
							
						<h3>Contract information</h3>	
						

The contract is a 2 year contract starting around April 2022. <br><br>

								<h2>Post-doctoral research fellowship in Space-time downscaling of rainfall extremes</h2>
							</header>
							<h3>Project Description</h3>
							
						
							RESILIENCE is structured on four Work Packages (WPs) and brings together an interdisciplinary group of scientists, from hydrologists, to climate modelers, to statisticians, to forest science experts. Within this structure, a research group based at the <a href="https://www.dicea.unipd.it/">Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering </a>will focus on novel statistical tools to infer local-scale (~point to 1 km scale) and short time scale (10 min- 1hr) extreme value statistics from Convection-Permitting and Regional Climate Model rainfall outputs (2.5-50 km in space and 1 day in time), as well as from remote sensing rainfall estimates. We envision using theoretical results based on general stochastic process properties (Marani, 2003; 2005) and applied successfully to the case of ordinary (i.e. non-extreme) temporal rainfall (Marani and Zanetti, 2007) and to ordinary and extreme space-time rainfall (Zorzetto and Marani, 2019).  Results will be tested against high-resolution rain-gauge observations and weather radar information. Other methods that will be explored include, but will not be limited to, machine learning algorithms (e.g. convolutional neural networks). The work will focus on the Italian Northeast region, for which ground and remote sensing rainfall estimates are available to the team, along with results from Convection Permitting Models and Regional Climate Models. Outcomes are expected to be used and useful for impact studies and engineering design, objectives that will be pursued through the collaborations within RESILIENCE. <br><br>
							
						<h3>Candidate profile</h3>	
The successful candidate will be a highly motivated researcher will to work within an interdiciplinary group and to collaborate with climate modellers at IUSS Pavia, atmospheric physicists at CNR Bologna, and hydrologists at the University of Padova. Specifically, candidates who completed PhD theses in Hydrology, Atmospheric Physics, Environmental Sciences, Statistics, or other related disciplines are sought. A strong background in stochastic modelling will be preferred. Other qualifications include significant programming skills and research abilities demonstrated by publications. 

The successful candidate will be based at the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering of the University of Padova and will collaborate with the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate of the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-ISAC). The candidate is expected to actively participate in the activities of the RESILIENCE team. <br><br>
